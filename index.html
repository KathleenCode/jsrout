                <p>Now is the winter of our discontent
                    Made glorious summer by this sun of York; <br />
                    And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house 
                    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. <br />
                    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
                    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; <br />
                    Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, 
                    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<br />
                    Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
                </p>
                <p>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
                    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br />

                    I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty <br />
                    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
                    I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
